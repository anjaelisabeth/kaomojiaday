# kaomojiaday
A really simple twitter bot that posts kaomoji twice a day from @kaomojiaday, written in Python 3. It also follows back all users when running. I made it partially to practice using github. Currently deployed on a friends server, in its current static state it will run out of content soon.... 
Eventual plan: scrape sites for more kaomoji (wikipedia?), respond to DM's with a random kaomoji, rename .py file to reflect "twice a day"

Initially I accidentally committed my twitter API keys... keys were updated from what was originally posted and hidden in most current version (oops!)
