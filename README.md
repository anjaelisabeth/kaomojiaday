# kaomojiaday
A really simple twitter bot that posts kaomoji twice a day from @kaomojiaday, written in Python 3. It also follows back all users when running. I made it partially to practice using github. 
Eventual plan: scrape sites for more kaomoji (wikipedia?), respond to DM's with a random kaomoji, rename .py file to reflect "twice a day"
